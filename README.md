## CNI Image Quality analysis

Methods based to read data from the CNI QA project and plot values over time.

We will start out relying on the Matlab scitran library.  Maybe we will move to other methods over time.

We will be tracing the SNR and SNFR values over time and making plots with the routines we put in here.
